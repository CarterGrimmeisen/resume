    I am a driven graduate student, currently seeking a Master's in Software Engineering. My wide variety of both
    personal and professional experience in the software field makes me a quick learner no matter the tech stack.
    I am a solution-oriented engineer and have a passion for optimizing developer experience. My current fascination is
    metaprogramming in TypeScript and I am continually thrilled to learn about up-and-coming technologies.
