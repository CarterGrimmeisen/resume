    I am a driven graduate student, currently seeking a Master's in Software Engineering. My wide variety of both personal and professional experience
    in the software field makes me a quick learner, no matter the tech stack. I am a solution-oriented engineer and have a passion for optimizing
    developer experience. My current fascination is metaprogramming in TypeScript, and I am continually thrilled to learn about up-and-coming technologies.
